Cannot run FLAMES on Windows as bioconda does not support it (https://github.com/mritchielab/FLAMES/issues/53), therefore use Linux scripts- Windows file is kept for archiving purposes.


1. Ran the Linux directory script- used FASTQ files which had gone through the pre-processing filtering as input
2. Ran NanoFLORA clean-stats on the isoform_annotated.gff3 output slurm-clean-stats.sh
